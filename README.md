**ASCILINE** is a high-performance, cross-platform real-time ASCII video rendering engine. It maps pixels to text-based representations and streams the result over a low-overhead binary protocol, turning the browser canvas into a typographic display surface.

## Design Goals

1. **Pure typographic manipulation**: the visual stream is raw HTML/Canvas text, not a standard media file. That means real-time CSS filters (glows, shadows, animations) can be applied directly to what would otherwise be a video.
2. **Zero GPU, ultra-low bandwidth (ASCII modes)**: standard codecs (H.264/VP9) need dedicated hardware decoders, which chokes microcontrollers and weak devices. ASCILINE does the heavy lifting server-side and streams lightweight text frames — fewer columns means proportionally less bandwidth. This makes fluid playback possible on constrained networks and zero-GPU devices (smart appliances, retro terminals, basic microcontrollers).
3. **Works everywhere**: no `<video>` tag, no browser-side codec decoding, no autoplay restrictions. To the browser, it's just text on a canvas.

> **Roadmap idea, not implemented yet:** because ASCII output is already a compact, structured text representation, it could in principle serve as a lightweight input for downstream text/LLM processing instead of feeding raw pixel streams to a vision model. Nothing in the current codebase does this — flagging it here as a direction, not a shipped feature.

## Technical Features

- **Cross-platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux.
- **Real-time ASCII and pixel streaming**: low-latency video-to-text conversion; pixel mode replaces characters with colored blocks, approaching 360p quality.
- **HTML5 Canvas rendering**, tuned for 24–30 FPS playback. Higher-FPS sources are automatically decimated for stability.
- **Master clock sync**: the audio track is the absolute time reference, keeping A/V synchronized.
- **Low-overhead binary protocol**: frames are streamed as raw `Uint8Array` straight to the canvas.
- **Multiple color modes**: from black & white up to 16M-color ultra-fidelity.
- **Flexible video management**: JSON playlists (per-video mode & volume), folder-based auto-queuing, single-file mode, infinite loop — all via CLI flags.

## Architecture

1. **Backend (Python/FastAPI)**: decodes video via OpenCV, maps pixels to ASCII via NumPy, streams binary frames.
2. **Frontend (vanilla JS)**: receives binary frames over WebSocket, manages a jitter buffer, renders to a canvas grid.
3. **Communication**: a custom `INIT` handshake negotiates resolution/FPS, followed by the binary frame stream.

## Adaptive Frame Codec (opt-in, ASCII modes 2–5)

The original protocol re-sends the full grid every frame. An opt-in adaptive codec picks the smallest of several encodings per frame and tags it with a 1-byte header, without changing the rendered output:

| tag | encoding | best for |
| :-- | :------- | :------- |
| `0` RAW | framebuffer as-is (legacy) | incompressible frames |
| `1` ZLIB | `zlib(framebuffer)` | general motion |
| `2` DELTA | only the cells that changed since the last frame | static / low-motion |
| `3` RLE_FULL | run-length encoded framebuffer | large flat-color regions |

Clients opt in with `/ws?codec=adaptive`; omit it and you get the original protocol byte-for-byte, so existing clients are unaffected. A keyframe is forced periodically so dropped packets / late joiners resync.

`codec.js` (the shared decoder used by both the live player and the test suite) understands all four tags. **Not every encoder produces all four**, though: the Python side (`codec.py`, used by the live server and by `static_player/compiler.py`) can emit RLE_FULL when it wins the size comparison. The browser-side JS encoder (`static_player/studio/encoder.js`, used by the client-only Studio compiler) intentionally only emits RAW/ZLIB/DELTA — it doesn't implement RLE run-building, to keep the in-browser encoder simple. RAW/ZLIB/DELTA already cover most cases reasonably well, so this is a deliberate simplicity/size trade-off, not a bug — decoders stay permissive, encoders stay conservative.

**Measured wire savings** (mode 5, 200×80 grid):

| content | vs. legacy |
| :------ | :--------- |
| static screen / slideshow | **0.3%** (≈375×) |
| high-motion / full-frame change | 63% (never worse than legacy) |

An optional `--quality {lossless,high,balanced,low}` enables lossy *temporal delta*: a color cell is only re-sent once it drifts past a tolerance from what the viewer already sees (the character plane stays exact), cutting the hard cases a further ~15–30% at imperceptible quality. Default is `lossless` (bit-exact).

**Monitor bandwidth in real time:** pass `--debug` when launching the server to see live RAW vs WIRE byte comparisons and the compression ratio in your terminal.

> Verified two independent ways, both bit-exact: Python-encoded vectors decoded by `codec.js` in Node (`experiments/gen_vectors.py` → `experiments/check_vectors.js`), and a live `adaptive`-vs-`legacy` WebSocket diff (`experiments/test_e2e.js`). Generate test clips with `experiments/make_test_clips.sh`.

**LAN / network streaming:** use `--host` to expose the server on your network.
```bash
python stream_server.py video.mp4 --host 0.0.0.0
```

## Zero-Dependency Static Web Player

ASCILINE can compile a video into a self-contained `.ascf` (ASCII Compressed Format) file and play it back with a static HTML page — no Python backend at runtime, hostable anywhere (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify).

> **Trade-off:** compiled `.ascf` files are naturally larger than standard `.mp4`. In exchange you get true DOM-level interaction, pixel-perfect text selection, and no dependency on the browser's video codecs.

There are two ways to produce a `.ascf` file:

### 1. Python compiler (more capable and faster — the recommended default)

```bash
python static_player/compiler.py your_video.mp4 --cols 250 --pixel --quantize 2
```

- `--quantize 0-3`: drops color bits to reduce file size (0 = lossless, 3 = aggressive).
- `--tolerance`: color drift tolerance before a pixel update is sent, to skip invisible changes.
- `--hard`: max zlib compression (level 9) — slower to compile, smaller output.

This is what powers the live demo at [asciline.dev](https://www.asciline.dev): the static clips there are compiled with this Python path.

### 2. Browser Studio — compile without installing anything

`static_player/studio/` is a standalone page (`index.html` + `encoder.js`, using `pako` from a CDN for deflate) that compiles a video to `.ascf` **entirely client-side** — drop a video in, get a `.ascf` out, nothing ever leaves the browser and no Python is required. It's the more experimental of the two paths (see the codec note above: it only emits RAW/ZLIB/DELTA, not RLE_FULL) and is best for quick, short clips rather than production output — for anything longer or size-sensitive, use the Python compiler.

### Playing a compiled file

Place the generated `.ascf` next to `static_player/index.html` and open it through any local web server.

> **Best practice:** compile short clips (under 5–10 minutes). `.ascf` stores raw render instructions for the canvas, so full-length movies can produce file sizes that exceed your browser's memory limits.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YusufB5/ASCILINE.git
cd ASCILINE
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn opencv-python numpy websockets
```

Running headless (server / no display, e.g. a VPS or container)? `opencv-python-headless` is a lighter drop-in replacement for `opencv-python` and avoids pulling in GUI dependencies you won't use.

**Optional — play from YouTube (and other yt-dlp sites):**
```bash
pip install yt-dlp
```
Only needed if you pass a URL instead of a local file. Local playback works without it. URL playback also uses FFmpeg (see below) to normalize downloads.

### FFmpeg & FFprobe (required for audio and thumbnails)

**Package manager (recommended):**
- Windows: `winget install ffmpeg`
- macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
- Linux: `sudo apt install ffmpeg`

**Manual (Windows):** if you hit a `FileNotFoundError` or don't want to touch system variables, download the [FFmpeg ZIP](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases/latest), extract `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` from `bin/`, and drop both into the project folder next to `stream_server.py`.

### 3. Run the web server

**Single video:**
```bash
python stream_server.py video.mp4 --cols 240
```

**YouTube / URL (requires `yt-dlp`):**
```bash
python stream_server.py "https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID" --cols 240
python stream_server.py "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=..." --cols 220 --loop
```

**Garbage collection for cached downloads:** ASCILINE includes an LRU cache limiter for on-demand YouTube downloads so disk usage doesn't grow unbounded.
```bash
python stream_server.py --cache-limit 5000   # cap the video cache at 5 GB (default 10240 MB)
```

**How caching works:**
- ASCII rendering only needs a small grid, so yt-dlp fetches at ≤480p to save bandwidth.
- Downloads are cached by video ID in `videos/` — replays are instant.
- Playlist/channel URLs and `playlist.json` expand into a queue and fetch on demand; the server starts immediately instead of waiting for bulk downloads.
- Every downloaded video is normalized to H.264/AAC constant frame rate, so A/V sync holds regardless of the source codec.

**Folder mode** — drop videos into `videos/` and run:
```bash
python stream_server.py --folder videos --cols 200
python stream_server.py --folder videos --cols 230 --loop
python stream_server.py --folder videos --mode 5 --pixel --cols 320 --vol 2
```
Videos play in filesystem order (as they appear in the folder, not alphabetically). Add/remove files to control the queue.

**JSON playlist** — per-video overrides:
```bash
python stream_server.py --playlist playlist.json --cols 220
python stream_server.py --playlist playlist.json --cols 220 --loop
```

Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### Player controls

Hover previews are built once per video on first hover, in a single ffmpeg pass, kept in memory — nothing written to disk. Disable with `--no-thumbnails`. To use a prebuilt sprite instead, point the `/scrub` route at it.

### Live webcam streaming

```bash
python stream_server.py --webcam --cols 240

# Different camera device and target FPS
python stream_server.py --webcam --webcam-device 1 --webcam-fps 60

# Disable the automatic horizontal mirror
python stream_server.py --webcam --no-mirror
```

### 4. Run directly in a terminal (standalone)

Bypass the web interface and render inside an ANSI-capable terminal (zero flicker, true color):
```bash
python ascii_video_player2.py video.mp4 --cols 100 --quality 0

# Webcam directly in the terminal
python ascii_video_player2.py --webcam --cols 100
```

> Don't resize the terminal window during playback — dynamic text wrapping will corrupt the layout.

## Customization

### Styling
Edit `style.css` to change accent colors and typography via CSS variables:
```css
:root {
    --accent-color: #00ff41; /* Classic Matrix Green */
    --bg-color: #050505;
}
```

### Real-time frontend filters & palettes (ASCII modes)

Click **FX** on the player controls (or press **F**) to open the filter overlay.

- **Contrast** — adjust the difference between light and dark areas
- **Brightness** — control the overall lightness of the output
- **Gamma** — recover detail from dark/washed-out sources
- **Sharpen** — Unsharp Mask, levels 0–10
- **Invert** — instantly invert all brightness values
- **Palettes** — swap character sets live:
  - `Default`: full detailed ASCII ramp
  - `Flat/Anime`: shortened, minimalist ramp (good for animation)
  - `Block`: chunky, dense characters for a retro-terminal look

### Rendering modes

```bash
python stream_server.py --mode 5 --cols 240 --rows 100
```
- `1`: Black & White (DOM mode)
- `2`: 512 colors
- `3`: 32K colors
- `4`: 262K colors
- `5`: 16M colors (ultra)

### Resolution & auto-scaling

Specify only `--cols`; ASCILINE derives `--rows` from the source aspect ratio.

- ASCII mode: `--cols 200`–`240` (recommended starting point for the best balance of detail and 30 FPS performance; can be increased if your hardware allows).
- Pixel mode: `--cols 600`–`900` (recommended starting point for near-HD quality; performance depends heavily on CPU).
- If `--cols` isn't set, defaults are `450` in pixel mode and `200` in ASCII mode.
- **Hardware limits & A/V sync:** pushing `--cols` beyond what your machine can encode/send in time causes the video to fall behind the audio (desync). If you see this, lower `--cols`.

```bash
python stream_server.py video.mp4 --mode 5 --cols 240
# Terminal shows: [AUTO] 1920x1080 → grid 240x67
```

### Server-side volume control

`--vol` (0–5). At `0`, FFmpeg's audio path never runs — saves CPU and bandwidth.

| `--vol` | Multiplier | |
|---------|------------|---|
| `0` | — | Muted (no processing) |
| `1` | 1.0× | Normal (default) |
| `3` | 1.5× | Loud |
| `5` | 2.0× | Double volume |

```bash
python stream_server.py video.mp4 --pixel --cols 560 --vol 0   # silent
python stream_server.py video.mp4 --cols 220 --vol 3           # loud
```

### Playlist format (`playlist.json`)

Each entry can override the global `--mode`, `--pixel`, `--vol`, and `--cols`:
```json
[
    { "video": "intro.mp4",  "mode": 1, "vol": 1 },
    { "video": "main.mp4",   "mode": 5, "pixel": true, "vol": 3, "cols": 520 },
    { "video": "https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID", "mode": 3, "vol": 2, "cols": 240 }
]
```
Paths are resolved automatically — the project root and `videos/` are both checked, so a filename alone is usually enough.
